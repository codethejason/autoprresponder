# Auto Responder to PR Bot
A bot that automatically comments to a new PR showing the live github.io link of the site. To use, edit the config array in *webhook.php* and the JSON at `secret.json`.

The NodeJS version is currently being developed in place of the PHP version. Later, it will be integrated with GitHub's OAuth capability to automatically install and manage a users' webhooks.
